Lakitu is essentially a DIY version of game streaming services such as OnLive and GeForce NOW. It runs on a Linux system with GPU passthrough and starts a Windows VM in response to requests for streaming from a device such as a [Steam Link](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8082-YJBN-9141) or another PC using [Steam In-Home Streaming](https://store.steampowered.com/streaming/). Lakitu can also serve multiple clients at once (given enough GPUs), including with alternate protocols such as [KVMFR](https://looking-glass.hostfission.com/) for local clients and a new open protocol (with lightweight open-source client).
